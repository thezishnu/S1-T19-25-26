## Abstract

  <summary>Detail</summary>
  
  >Core Background
>• Natural disasters like floods, cyclones, earthquakes, and tsunamis cause major damage.
>• Early warning helps to reduce loss of life and property.
>• This project uses digital logic to detect possible disasters automatically.
>• It works on simple sensor-like binary inputs representing environment factors.
>Project Working
>• The system takes 8-bit input (2 bits each for Rainfall, Seismic, Wind, and Sea Level).
>• Each 2-bit code shows the level: Low, Medium, High, or Very High.
>• Comparators, AND/OR/XOR gates, and decoders process these inputs.
>• Logic equations decide which disaster condition matches the given inputs.
>• A priority encoder and multiplexer ensure only one LED glows at a time.
>• The output is a glowing LED showing one disaster: Flood, Cyclone, Earthquake, or Tsunami.
>Applications & Educational Value
>• The LEDs act as warning indicators for different conditions.
>• The design is simple, low-cost, and based on basic logic ICs.
>• It can be used in educational labs to learn digital system design concepts.
>• The project demonstrates practical use of comparators, encoders, and multiplexers in safety systems.
